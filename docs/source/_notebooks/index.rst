Chain API Guide
---------------


This section presents links to GridR's chain methods. These "chain" methods offer users a way to leverage functionalities while managing raster I/O, memory, and CPU resources. They serve as the primary entry point for users to interact with GridR using file inputs.
Several pages are generated from Jupyter notebooks, with links to the original .ipynb sources also provided.
